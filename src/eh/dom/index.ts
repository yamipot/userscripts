/**
 * Boundary between the original E-H document and EhPeek components.
 *
 * A feature function owns the complete source-DOM contract for one feature:
 * selectors, data extraction, required-node validation, ownership decisions,
 * and original class/style/attribute handling stay together in this package.
 * Components consume its `XxxDom` object directly and must not query the
 * original page.
 *
 * Source nodes are read only through `DomNode`. Validate every required node
 * before taking ownership and return `null` when the feature cannot be resolved.
 * `inplace`, `clone`, and `move` fix ownership immediately without applying
 * presentation changes; `move` also detaches the source node. Repeated
 * acquisition is supported.
 * Use `DomNode.observe` for asynchronously inserted source nodes and choose
 * ownership in its acquire callback; use `ManagedDomNode.observe` after ownership.
 *
 * Managed `XxxDom` objects separate detached values in `data`, owned nodes in
 * `elems`, and callable behavior in the non-null `handle` object. Every `elems`
 * property must be `ManagedDomNode`, `ManagedDomNode[]`, or `null`; nested
 * element-bearing objects and raw DOM nodes are not allowed. Components embed
 * these nodes through `Component` or render into an owned anchor through
 * `mount`, never through a raw-node getter.
 * EhPeek installation markers are created with `createAnchor` rather than by
 * treating a component's presentation class as installation state.
 *
 * Each `handle` method owns one coherent operation, including delayed
 * presentation changes, imperative effects, and event subscriptions.
 * Persistent observable values belong in component state. A handle may accept a
 * component-owned ref as a semantic mount or mirror
 * target, but it must never return a raw original-page node.
 * Original-page event subscriptions are installed and removed here; expose
 * semantic callbacks instead of making callers pass `event.target` back in.
 * Keep one-off resolve/apply helpers inside their feature function; only parsers
 * shared by multiple features or repeated document loads belong at module scope.
 * Public feature entry points use `manageXxx` when they return owned DOM and
 * lifecycle handles, `mutateXxx` when they apply an immediate page mutation,
 * and `extractXxx` only for detached data. App page injection coordinates
 * these entry points. Async providers may manage fetched documents; later DOM
 * refreshes stay behind the source's handle. Pure EhPeek-owned
 * mounts and global styles belong to App rather than this original-page boundary.
